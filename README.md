## Rules of Four Connect
* You will start as player One.
* You will take your go as player One.
* You will not be allowed to go in squares that are not at the bottom of the grid, or do not have a taken square under it.
* Once your go is taken and you did not win, It will be player Two's go.
* The gamer will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
